Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
-  JAVA is always a pass by value programming language.

To test whether a programming language is passing by value or passing by reference, we usually use the
swap method. This method aims to swap an object to another object.
- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?
 The swap function only does not change the original ones , it changes the references of the copied objects, 
- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
When we call changeTitle(), we pass the value of jungleDVD reference to parameter dvd, meaning that dvd points to jungleDVD object.
In changeTitle method, we set the title of the object that dvd points to (jungleDVD object) to a new title.
Therefore jungleDVD object will have the new title, and when we get the new title through jungleDVD reference in main, we will see the change.
